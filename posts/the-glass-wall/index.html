  <div class="post-content"><p>An extraordinary year comes to an end, just like many others, yet I distinctly remember that one year when a remarkable entourage of human beings gathered around me. I had hoped our story would have a happy ending, but sometimes wishes don&rsquo;t come true. Now, staring at the glass wall, I see only myself, alone, burdened with a heavy bag of despair and endless remorse. The seeds I had sown were now bearing their bitter fruit. But my story wasn&rsquo;t always like this.</p>
<p>There was a time when I saw her in my reflection. Her enchanting beauty, meticulously refracted through her glasses, captivated me. No matter how small my angle of incidence, the image I received was larger than life. Deep down, I never anticipated that my angle would diminish to a critical point, plunging me into eternal darkness. My story began with a plasma wall, commonly known as a monitor or personal computer, where I first learned about this incredible person. I don&rsquo;t know when we became close, but somehow, streams of binary bits connected us. Those simple sequences of zeros and ones profoundly impacted my life, and they still do.</p>
<p>At times, I find myself staring at that same plasma wall, reading past conversations. The color has faded; there&rsquo;s no color at all. It makes no sense to revisit a past that was once colorful and radiant, yet I do, reading some paragraphs so many times that I no longer need a screen to see them. They come naturally.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I chased many dreams. Some came true, but most failed. When dreams fail, the glass wall in which I see myself sometimes shatters, its fragments piercing me, leaving me asphyxiated and bleeding. Then came a day when I lost everything and found myself drowning in an ocean of melancholy, unable to scream or signal for help. But I found comfort in a surprising place.</p>
<p>Every nightmare ends, and so did mine. I felt the gentle touch of someone on my forehead, a reminder that the world hadn&rsquo;t ended. Everyone is haunted by their past, but some carry haunted stories. Reaching their zenith, they see their problems as minuscule and keep moving forward, fueled by each challenge.</p>
<p>I came to know her. Slowly, I cleared the mist from my glass wall and saw her as my reflection. I had found the love of my life. Love ballads and romantic literature suddenly made sense. I began to dream again and regained my life. It seemed like a stroke of luck, as if a talisman had been placed under my pillow.</p>
<p>But one day, my reflection started to fade. I watched her leave, unable to stop the widening cracks. She tried to mend them but only got hurt in the process. I never wanted that for her. I wanted the best for her, but I ultimately failed. The crack remains, my reflection now distorted. Yet, I felt grateful to have been loved by her. I left behind a silent tear and a hopeful wish, knowing it was impossible for us to converge again in this space and time. The winter chill froze me inside, deepening my coldness.</p>
<p>Years later, I see her again. I had always hoped for a meaningful beginning and a strong ending to our story. I searched for my glass wall, finding only distorted fragments in my attic. Now, I see the love of my life. She&rsquo;s happier – married, successful, with Ivy League degrees and beautiful children. I long to cross the street, talk to her, and express my undying love. But I don&rsquo;t, or rather, I can&rsquo;t. Not out of fear of societal judgment, but because I want to preserve the dream she once had. I wish to do something as simple as holding her hand and promising never to let go. But I still don&rsquo;t, or rather, I can&rsquo;t. Long ago, I left this world&hellip;</p>
