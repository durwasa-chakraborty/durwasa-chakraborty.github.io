      <description>Preface: Rishi Durvasa, known for his irascible nature, was infamous for his ability to curse. As mythology suggests, Durvasa visited Kanav Rishi&amp;rsquo;s ashram, and Shakuntala was lost in her daydreams of Dushyant. Furious, Durvasa cursed Shakuntala, saying that the one she dreamed of would forget her when the time came. This is a modern retelling of that ancient story.
The ceiling fans at Kanav Caf√© whirred lazily above, barely stirring the humid afternoon air.</description>

      <description>Am I too comfortable or am I dying from within
I wish at the word go I could drop my skin
The quotes of the dead do not interest me
Nor does the aphorism of the sickened living
I am still searching for lost letters and their meaning
To go back to the gardens of my uninterrupted musing
And every night I hope to find the old you;
And every day I hope for a new story to begin.</description>
