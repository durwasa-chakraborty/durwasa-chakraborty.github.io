      <description>Introduction For someone who has taken a course in Computer Science, they have probably come across a B+ tree, often used in the context of databases for storing data. A B+ tree schematically looks like this:
[ 1003 ] / | \ [1001] [1002] [1004 1005] [1007] / | | | [Naruto] [Sasuke] [Sakura Hinata Kakashi] [Itachi] In a B+ tree, the data always lies in the leaf nodes.
However, what are the advantages of using such a structure in a database?</description>

      <description>Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.
Before you think I&amp;rsquo;m crowning Lisp as God&amp;rsquo;s own language after just one blog stint at a coding exercise, hold your horses. I&amp;rsquo;m not here to bash Object-Oriented Programming or its design patterns. In fact, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to know these patterns inside out. Only then can you play the game of &amp;lsquo;Design Pattern or Anti-Pattern?</description>

      <title>STR: A Disciplined Programmer</title>

      <description>A trainee undergoing military training can disassemble and assemble a machine gun within a minute. At first, this might seem very complex, but everyone in the academy manages to do it. The more pertinent question is not &amp;lsquo;how&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s because their lives depend on it. Similarly, a disciplined programmer learns the vocabulary and syntax of a programming language with utmost sincerity. Every word in the programming language is sacred, and any non-conformance is akin to blasphemy.</description>

      <title>The 00 Estate: What Happens When the Government Dictates How to Write Code?</title>

      <description>In the House of Commons of Great Britain, Edmund Burke once stated, &amp;ldquo;There were Three Estates in Parliament; but, in the Reportersâ€™ Gallery yonder, there sat a Fourth Estate more important than them all.&amp;rdquo; As the 21st century dawned, we observed media houses displaying biases towards their respective lobbies. The &amp;rsquo;truth,&amp;rsquo; which should be absolute, now has shades of well-crafted absolution. &amp;ldquo;Whose truth is the truth?&amp;rdquo; is a question I often ask myself while reading news articles on the internet.</description>

      <description>An extraordinary year comes to an end, just like many others, yet I distinctly remember that one year when a remarkable entourage of human beings gathered around me. I had hoped our story would have a happy ending, but sometimes wishes don&amp;rsquo;t come true. Now, staring at the glass wall, I see only myself, alone, burdened with a heavy bag of despair and endless remorse. The seeds I had sown were now bearing their bitter fruit.</description>
